  "prompt": "Create a minimalist typographic illustration displayed on a front-facing monitor screen of the Gemini Actions Lab, using only the letters in the words 'GEMINI ACTIONS LAB - v0.3.2 -'. Each letter should be creatively shaped or positioned to form different parts of the Gemini Actions Lab interface. The design must appear as if it is glowing on the monitor, clean, ultra-minimalist, and entirely composed of the modified 'GEMINI ACTIONS LAB' letters without adding extra shapes or lines. The letters should flow and curve to mimic the natural form of a futuristic experimental laboratory, evoking digital control panels, modular structures, and cosmic duality, while still remaining legible.

The monitor should be flat, facing directly forward, with crisp edges and subtle reflections to emphasize a modern display device. The typographic design should fill most of the screen space with balanced composition.

On the left side of the monitor, place minimalistic laboratory objects such as sleek glass flasks, tubes, and experimental devices. On the right side, place futuristic modular consoles, levers, and glowing indicators. Both sides should remain minimalist, stylized, and consistent with the typographic design, complementing the central monitor without distracting from it.

Use a restrained color palette of deep green, vivid red, golden yellow, warm off-white, and charcoal black to enhance the modern, refined aesthetic.",
