  "prompt": "Create a minimalist typographic illustration displayed on a front-facing monitor screen of the Gemini Actions Lab, using only the letters in the words 'GEMINI ACTIONS LAB'. Each letter should be creatively shaped or positioned to form different parts of the Gemini Actions Lab interface. The design must appear as if it is glowing on the monitor, clean, ultra-minimalist, and entirely composed of the modified 'GEMINI ACTIONS LAB' letters without adding extra shapes or lines. The letters should flow and curve to mimic the natural form of a futuristic experimental laboratory, evoking digital control panels, modular structures, and cosmic duality, while still remaining legible.",
